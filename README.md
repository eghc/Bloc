1. HTML - I learned that it is best to use descriptive html tags instead so that it is easy for a screen reader to interpret. I also learned when to use a class vs. an id.

2. CSS - I got more practice with parent/child styling. I was not very good at this before and always just guessed with my CSS to make pages look a certain way.

3. Career -  My mentor did not skip a beat when I told him that I would like to advance my career within my company. He told me I should start talking to them about a timeline for me to become a front-end developer. I am sometimes afraid to ask for what I want at jobs.
